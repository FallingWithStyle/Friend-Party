THE CURRENT ISSUE



Taking a break from this app for a bit.

Summary of Recent Changes (AI written)
You've implemented a comprehensive peer assessment feature, which includes:

Backend: A new database table and a function to generate peer assessment assignments, along with API endpoints to start the process, fetch assignments, and finish the questionnaire.
Frontend: The main questionnaire component was updated to handle the peer assessment flow, and the results page now tracks members who haven't finished.
Debugging: You've added a suite of debugging tools, including a DebugToolbar for resetting party state, an API for logging stats, and another for resetting party data.
What's Broken
The core problem remains: the peer assessment questionnaire does not load. The application appears to get stuck, likely waiting for data that never arrives.

What We've Tried
Investigation: I analyzed the three key files involved: the API endpoint that serves the assignments (peer-assessment-assignments/route.ts), the page that displays the questionnaire (questionnaire/peer/page.tsx), and the shared questionnaire component (UnifiedQuestionnaire.tsx).
Hypothesis: My primary theory is that the API endpoint is either failing silently or returning an empty list of assignments. The questionnaire component has a loading condition that waits for assignments to be present, and if they never arrive, it will remain in a loading state indefinitely.
Logging: To validate this, I added detailed logging to the peer-assessment-assignments API endpoint to trace its execution flow and see precisely what data is being returned. We were about to analyze these logs when we paused.
What I Think Will Fix It
Given the new functionality, the point of failure has likely moved upstream from the peer-assessment-assignments endpoint itself. The problem probably lies in the logic that creates the assignments in the first place.

Your commit message mentions that the start-questionnaire route was updated to "check for existing distributions and generate them if necessary." This is the most likely source of the error. It's possible that:

The check for an existing distribution is flawed, causing it to incorrectly believe assignments have already been created.
The call to the generate_peer_assessment_distribution database function is failing silently or is not being triggered under the correct conditions.
To fix this, I would investigate the start-questionnaire API route to ensure it reliably generates the peer assessment assignments for every user when they begin the questionnaire. This is the critical step that provides the data the rest of the system depends on.
