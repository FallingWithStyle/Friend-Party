# Story 2.2: Self-Assessment Questionnaire

## Status
Completed

## User Story
**As a** Party Member,
**I want** to answer questions about myself,
**so that** I can establish my baseline personality profile.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  After joining a party, the user is presented with a series of 'self-assessment' questions fetched from the database.
2.  The UI presents one question at a time in a clear, card-based format.
3.  User answers are saved to an `answers` table in Supabase, linked to the user and the specific question.
4.  Upon completing the last question, the user is automatically advanced to the peer-assessment step.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement questionnaire page to fetch and render questions sequentially (`friend-party-app/src/app/party/[code]/questionnaire/page.tsx`)
- [x] Save self-assessment answers to `answers` table
- [x] Entry point from Lobby to start/continue questionnaire (`friend-party-app/src/app/party/[code]/page.tsx`)
- [x] API to mark user status when starting questionnaire (`friend-party-app/src/app/api/party/[code]/start-questionnaire/route.ts`)
- [-] Automatic advance to peer-assessment on final question (handled in Story 2.3; tracked there)

## Dev Agent Record

### File List
- **Modified:** `friend-party-app/database/init.sql`
- **Created:** `friend-party-app/src/app/party/[code]/questionnaire/page.tsx`
- **Created:** `friend-party-app/src/app/api/party/[code]/start-questionnaire/route.ts`
- **Modified:** `friend-party-app/src/app/party/[code]/page.tsx`

### Completion Notes
- Created the `answers` table in the database to store user responses.
- Implemented a new questionnaire page that fetches and displays self-assessment questions one at a time.
- Added a "Start/Continue QUESTionnaire" button to the party lobby to provide an entry point to the questionnaire.
- Created an API endpoint to update the user's status to 'Voting' when they begin the questionnaire.
- User answers are saved to the `answers` table.
- The final acceptance criterion ("Upon completing the last question, the user is automatically advanced to the peer-assessment step") is implemented and verified as part of Story 2.3; this story considers it satisfied via integration.

- **v1.0.0:** Initial implementation of the self-assessment questionnaire.
