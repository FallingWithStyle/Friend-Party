# Story 1.6: Propose and Select Adventurer Names

## User Story
**As a** party member,  
**I want** to propose and vote on adventurer names,  
**so that** the party can collectively choose a name for the new adventurer.

## Voting System
- All party members (except the one being named) get to vote on proposed adventurer names.
- Each member has one vote per naming event.
- The name with the most votes wins.

## Tie-Breaking Rules
- If there is a tie for the most votes, the member being named gets to cast the deciding vote.
- If there is *not* a tie, the member being named does not get a vote.
- The Party Leader's role is to break ties only if the person being named cannot or does not.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A mechanism for party members to vote on proposed names.
2. Real-time visibility of vote counts.
3. A clear process for handling ties, specifying who breaks the tie (the named member first, then the leader as a fallback).
4. The final selected name is assigned as the `adventurer_name`.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-12
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
The initial implementation successfully met the functional requirements of the story. However, several opportunities for improvement in code quality, consistency, and security were identified and addressed through refactoring. The changes enhance the long-term maintainability and robustness of the feature.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: `friend-party-app/database/init.sql`
  - **Change**: Modified the `id` columns of the `name_proposals` and `name_proposal_votes` tables from `BIGINT` to `UUID`.
  - **Why**: To maintain schema consistency. The rest of the database uses `UUID` for primary keys, and aligning with this standard prevents potential issues with data type mismatches and simplifies relationships.
  - **How**: Changed the column type to `UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()` and updated the foreign key reference in `name_proposal_votes`.

- **File**: `friend-party-app/src/app/api/party/[code]/finalize-name/route.ts`
  - **Change**: Added server-side validation to verify that a tie-breaking vote is only possible when a legitimate tie exists.
  - **Why**: To improve security and prevent misuse of the endpoint. Relying solely on the frontend to enforce this rule is insecure.
  - **How**: Implemented logic to fetch all active proposals and their votes, calculate the vote counts, and confirm that the selected proposal is part of a genuine tie before proceeding.

- **File**: `friend-party-app/src/app/party/[code]/page.tsx`
  - **Change**: Corrected all frontend type definitions to use `string` for all `id` and `proposal_id` fields, aligning them with the `UUID` type used in the database.
  - **Why**: To ensure type safety and resolve all TypeScript errors. The previous implementation had mismatches between `number` and `string` types, which could lead to runtime bugs.
  - **How**: Updated the `NameProposal` and `NameProposalVote` interfaces and all related function calls and comparisons to consistently use the `string` type for identifiers.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: [✓]
- Project Structure: [✓]
- Testing Strategy: [ ] (No testing infrastructure exists)
- All ACs Met: [✓]

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Refactored database schema for type consistency.
- [x] Added server-side validation for tie-breaking logic.
- [x] Improved frontend type safety by removing `any` types and correcting type definitions.
- [ ] Consider adding integration tests for the new API endpoints to verify voting and finalization logic.

### Security Review
- The `finalize-name` endpoint is now more secure with the addition of server-side tie-breaking validation, preventing unauthorized name changes.

### Performance Considerations
- No significant performance issues were identified. The real-time subscriptions are filtered and should scale appropriately for the expected number of users in a party.

### Final Status
[✓ Approved - Ready for Done]
