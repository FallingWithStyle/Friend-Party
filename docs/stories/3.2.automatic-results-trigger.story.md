# Story 3.2: Automatic Results Trigger
**As a** Party Member,  
**I want** the results to be automatically calculated and revealed once the last person has finished their questions,  
**so that** we can all see them at the same time.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. The system can detect when all members in a party have a status of 'Finished'.
2. When the last member's status changes to 'Finished', the results calculation logic from Story 3.1 is automatically triggered.
3. After calculation is complete, the overall party status is updated to 'ResultsReady'.
4. The Lobby screen automatically navigates all connected users to the Results Screen when the party status becomes 'ResultsReady'.
