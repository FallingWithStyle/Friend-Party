# Story 1.2: Join Party
**As a** User,  
**I want** to join an existing party using a code,  
**so that** I can participate with my friends.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. On the landing page, a user enters a 6-letter code and clicks "Join Party".
2. The application queries the Supabase `parties` table to find a party with a matching code.
3. If the code is valid, the user is prompted to enter their name and is added as a member to the party in Supabase.
4. If the code is invalid, an error message is displayed.
5. After successfully joining, the user is redirected to the Lobby screen.

## Test Coverage Requirements
- **TC1**: Unit tests for party joining API endpoint
- **TC2**: Integration tests for party code validation and member insertion
- **TC3**: Component tests for join party UI and form validation
- **TC4**: API tests for error handling (invalid codes, party not found, already joined)
- **TC5**: E2E tests for complete party joining flow
- **TC6**: Tests for duplicate member prevention and edge cases
