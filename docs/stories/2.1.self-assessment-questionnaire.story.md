# Story 2.1: Self-Assessment Questionnaire
**As a** Party Member,  
**I want** to answer questions about myself,  
**so that** I can establish my baseline personality profile.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. After joining a party, the user is presented with a series of 'self-assessment' questions fetched from the database.
2. The UI presents one question at a time in a clear, card-based format.
3. User answers are saved to an `answers` table in Supabase, linked to the user and the specific question.
4. Upon completing the last question, the user is automatically advanced to the peer-assessment step.

## Test Coverage Requirements
- **TC1**: Unit tests for questionnaire data fetching and processing
- **TC2**: Integration tests for answer saving and database operations
- **TC3**: Component tests for questionnaire UI and navigation
- **TC4**: API tests for questionnaire endpoints and error handling
- **TC5**: E2E tests for complete self-assessment flow
