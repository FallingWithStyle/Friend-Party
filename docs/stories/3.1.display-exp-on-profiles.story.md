# Story 3.1: Display EXP on Profiles
**As a** Party Member,  
**I want** to see the EXP I and others have earned,  
**so that** there is a fun, simple progression system.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. The results calculation logic also calculates EXP earned by each user.
2. A user's total EXP is displayed on their "character sheet" on the Results Screen.
3. The EXP has no gameplay function but serves as a cosmetic indicator of participation.
