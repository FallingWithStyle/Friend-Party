# Story 2.2: Peer-Assessment Questionnaire
**As a** Party Member,  
**I want** to answer questions about my fellow party members,  
**so that** I can contribute to the group's perception of their stats.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. After the self-assessment, the user is presented with a series of 'peer-assessment' questions.
2. For each question, the user must provide an answer for every *other* member of the party.
3. The UI allows the user to easily cycle through party members to answer the same question for each of them.
4. All answers are saved to the `answers` table, linked to the voting user, the subject user, and the question.
5. Upon completion, the user is taken to the Lobby/Waiting screen.
