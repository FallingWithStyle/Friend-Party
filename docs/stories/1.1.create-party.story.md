# Story 1.1: Create Party
**As a** Party Creator,  
**I want** to create a new party,  
**so that** I can get a unique code to share with my friends.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. Clicking "Create Party" navigates the user to a party creation screen.
2. Upon submission, a new record is created in the `parties` table in Supabase with a unique, randomly generated 6-letter code.
3. The creator is automatically added as the first member and designated as the "Party Leader".
4. After successful creation, the user is redirected to the Lobby, and the party code is displayed.

## Test Coverage Requirements
- **TC1**: Unit tests for party creation API endpoint
- **TC2**: Integration tests for database operations (party creation, member insertion)
- **TC3**: Component tests for party creation UI
- **TC4**: API tests for error handling (duplicate codes, database failures)
- **TC5**: E2E tests for complete party creation flow
- **TC6**: Tests for party code generation uniqueness and format validation
