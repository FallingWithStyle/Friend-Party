# Story 2.4: Results Calculation Logic
**As a** Developer,  
**I need** to implement the logic that calculates a user's final stats and class based on the collected answers,  
**so that** the results can be displayed.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. A Supabase Edge Function or client-side script is created to process the data from the `answers` table.
2. The logic aggregates all self-assessment and peer-assessment answers for each user.
3. A defined algorithm translates the aggregated answers into D&D-style stats (e.g., Strength, Dexterity, Charisma).
4. A defined algorithm assigns a D&D class (e.g., Bard, Fighter, Wizard) based on the final stats.
5. The calculated stats and class are saved to the `party_members` table for each user.
