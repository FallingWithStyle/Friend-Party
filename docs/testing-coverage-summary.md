# Test Coverage Improvement Summary

## Overview
Created Epic 7.1: Improve Test Coverage and updated existing stories to include testing requirements.

## Current Test Coverage Status
- **Overall Coverage**: 6.43% statements, 6.43% lines (significantly below 25% threshold)
- **Branches**: 71.73% (above threshold)
- **Functions**: 60.3% (above threshold)
- **Test Failures**: 25 out of 152 tests currently failing

## Epic 7.1: Improve Test Coverage
**File**: `docs/stories/7.1.improve-test-coverage.story.md`

### Key Features:
- Comprehensive coverage analysis by category
- 4-phase implementation plan (4 sprints)
- Specific coverage targets for different areas
- Technical requirements and CI/CD integration
- Risk mitigation strategies

### Coverage Targets:
- **Critical Business Logic**: 80%+ coverage
- **API Routes**: 60%+ coverage  
- **Page Components**: 50%+ coverage
- **Utility Functions**: 90%+ coverage (already achieved)
- **UI Components**: 80%+ coverage (mostly achieved)

## Updated Stories with Test Coverage Requirements

### Epic 1: Party Management
- ✅ **Story 1.1: Create Party** - Added 6 test coverage requirements
- ✅ **Story 1.2: Join Party** - Added 6 test coverage requirements

### Epic 2: Questionnaire System  
- ✅ **Story 2.1: Self-Assessment Questionnaire** - Added 6 test coverage requirements
- ✅ **Story 2.2: Peer-Assessment Questionnaire** - Added 6 test coverage requirements
- ✅ **Story 2.3: Propose and Vote on Party Motto** - Added 6 test coverage requirements

### Stories Already Having Test Coverage
- **Story 4.1: Implement Hireling Conversion Voting Backend** - Already has comprehensive testing section
- **Story 4.5: Dragon's Hoard Minigame** - Already has test coverage requirements

## Test Coverage Requirements Template
Each updated story now includes:
- **TC1**: Unit tests for core logic
- **TC2**: Integration tests for database operations
- **TC3**: Component tests for UI
- **TC4**: API tests for endpoints and error handling
- **TC5**: E2E tests for complete user flows
- **TC6**: Specific tests for edge cases and validation

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Fix the 25 failing tests to get accurate coverage metrics
2. **Phase 1**: Focus on API route testing (highest impact)
3. **Phase 2**: Add page component tests
4. **Phase 3**: Complete component and hook testing
5. **Phase 4**: Achieve coverage targets and CI/CD integration

## Impact
- **Risk Reduction**: Better test coverage will catch bugs before production
- **Development Confidence**: Safer refactoring and feature additions
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated validation of critical functionality
- **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and extend the codebase
