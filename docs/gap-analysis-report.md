# Gap Analysis Report - Friend Party

**Report Date:** 2025-07-12
**Analysis by:** Roo, Architect Agent

## 1. Executive Summary

This report provides a gap analysis comparing the features defined in the Product Requirements Document (PRD) with the features that have been implemented in the codebase.

The analysis shows that **Epic 1: Foundation & Party Management** is largely complete, and significant foundational work for **Epic 2: The Questionnaire Engine** has been done. However, the core functionality of Epics 2 and 3, as well as all of Epic 4, remains to be implemented.

The project is tracking well against the MVP goals, but there are several key features that need to be prioritized to complete the core user experience.

## 3. Key Findings & Gaps

### Gap 1: Peer-Assessment Functionality (High Priority)
- **Description:** The application currently ends after the self-assessment questionnaire. The entire peer-assessment flow, which is central to the core gameplay loop, is missing.
- **Required Stories:** 2.3, 2.4

### Gap 2: Results Generation & Display (High Priority)
- **Description:** There is no system in place to calculate or display the final results. This is the primary payoff for the user and is a critical missing piece of the MVP.
- **Required Stories:** 3.1, 3.2, 3.3

### Gap 3: Collaborative Party Motto (Medium Priority)
- **Description:** While the database has been updated to support a party motto, the frontend UI and backend logic to allow users to propose and vote on a motto have not been implemented.
- **Required Stories:** 2.5

### Gap 4: Post-MVP Features (Low Priority)
- **Description:** The features related to sharing results, displaying EXP, modernizing the UI, and adding Discord login are all post-MVP and have not been started, which is appropriate for this stage of the project.
- **Required Stories:** 3.4, 3.5, 4.1, 4.2

## 4. Recommendations & Next Steps

1.  **Prioritize Epic 2:** The immediate focus should be on completing the remaining stories in Epic 2: The Questionnaire Engine. This includes building the peer-assessment UI (Story 2.3), implementing the logic to update member status (Story 2.4), and creating the party motto voting system (Story 2.5).
2.  **Implement Epic 3:** Once the questionnaire engine is complete, development should move directly to Epic 3 to implement the results calculation and display. This will complete the core MVP functionality.
3.  **Defer Epic 4:** The UI modernization and polish tasks in Epic 4 should remain a lower priority until the core functionality is fully implemented and validated.
