# Self-Assessment Questions

This document contains the list of self-assessment questions for the "Friend Party" application. These questions are designed for users to answer about themselves to establish a baseline personality profile.

---

1.  You find a mysterious, glowing potion. Do you drink it immediately, try to identify it first, or offer it to a friend to test?
2.  When planning a group trip, are you the one with the detailed spreadsheet, the one who just shows up, or the one who convinces everyone to go somewhere completely different?
3.  A heated debate breaks out at a dinner party. Do you mediate to find common ground, use facts and logic to win, or create a diversion with a hilarious story?
4.  Your team is facing a tight deadline. Are you the one staying up all night to get it done, the one who finds a clever shortcut, or the one keeping morale high with snacks and encouragement?
5.  You're given a complex gadget with no instructions. Do you start pressing buttons randomly, read the manual cover-to-cover, or try to build something even better with the parts?
6.  When you enter a room, do you tend to command attention naturally, blend into the background, or observe quietly from a corner?
7.  Your ideal weekend involves a strenuous mountain hike, a competitive board game tournament, or a relaxing day with a good book?
8.  If you had to survive in the wilderness, would your greatest asset be your physical endurance, your knowledge of edible plants, or your ability to befriend a bear?
9.  You're offered a choice of one superpower. Do you choose super strength, the ability to read minds, or the power of flight?
10. When assembling furniture, are you more likely to follow the instructions perfectly, improvise when a piece doesn't fit, or end up with a "unique" creation and some leftover screws?
11. **Troll Negotiation:** Who is more likely to successfully negotiate with a grumpy troll â€“ the one with a silver tongue or the one with a compelling argument?
12. **Wilderness Survival:** When lost in a dense forest, who would you trust more to lead the way out: the one with a keen sense of direction or the one who seems to have an encyclopedic knowledge of nature?
13. **Agility Challenge:** If a priceless artifact is protected by a maze of laser beams, who is more likely to get through unscathed: the nimble acrobat or the clever strategist who finds the off switch?
14. **Bar Fight:** A friendly tavern brawl breaks out. Who would you rather have on your side: the person who can take a punch or the person who can end the fight with a single, intimidating glare?
15. **Ancient Riddle:** Faced with a cryptic, ancient riddle, who is more likely to solve it: the one who pores over dusty tomes for the answer or the one who has a sudden, brilliant flash of insight?
16. **Resourcefulness:** When the party is ambushed by goblins, who is more likely to have the perfect, unexpected item in their backpack to save the day?
17. **Social Grace:** At a royal ball, who is more likely to charm the entire court: the one with the most dazzling dance moves or the one with the most captivating stories?
18. **Bravery vs. Caution:** A rickety rope bridge spans a deep chasm. Who is more likely to test it first, and who is more likely to find a safer way around?
19. **Escape Plan:** If the party is captured, who is more likely to devise the escape plan: the meticulous planner who accounts for every detail or the bold improviser who creates chaos?
20. **Campfire Stories:** Who is the better storyteller around the campfire: the one who weaves epic tales of heroism or the one who tells spine-chilling ghost stories?
