# Friend Party UI/UX Specification

## Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for Friend Party - a social web application that gamifies personality profiling within friend groups using D&D-style stats and classes.

### Overall UX Goals & Principles

#### Target User Personas

1. **The Adventurous Gamer**: D&D enthusiasts who want to bring gaming elements to their social interactions. Tech-savvy and familiar with RPG mechanics.
2. **The Social Coordinator**: Friends who love organizing group activities and want new ways to engage their social circles.
3. **The Casual Participant**: People who enjoy lighthearted social games but may not be familiar with D&D mechanics.

#### Usability Goals

1. **Engaging Onboarding**: New users can create or join a party and start answering questions within 2 minutes
2. **Intuitive Gameplay**: The D&D-inspired mechanics should be immediately understandable even to non-gamers
3. **Social Sharing**: Easy ways to share results and invite friends to join parties
4. **Retro Aesthetic**: The interface should evoke nostalgia for classic D&D materials while remaining modern and accessible

#### Design Principles

1. **D&D Authenticity**: Use visual language and terminology familiar to D&D players

### Animation & Micro-interactions

#### Motion Principles

1. Subtle magical effects for interactions
2. Retro-inspired transitions between states
3. Purposeful motion that enhances understanding
