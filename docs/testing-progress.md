## 📝 Notes & Observations

### What's Working Well
- ✅ **Pure utility functions** are easy to test and have high coverage
- ✅ **Existing test patterns** are clean and maintainable
- ✅ **Vitest setup** is working well for current tests
- ✅ **100% pass rate** shows good test quality

### Challenges & Solutions
- 🔴 **External dependencies** make testing complex
  - **Solution**: Use MSW for API mocking, dependency injection
- 🔴 **React components** have heavy external service calls
  - **Solution**: Mock services, test business logic separately
- 🔴 **State management** has async operations
  - **Solution**: Mock external calls, test state transitions

### Lessons Learned
- **Start with business logic** - easier to test and high value
- **Mock external dependencies** - focus on testing your code, not third-party services
- **Progressive complexity** - build testing foundation before tackling complex components
- **Maintain test quality** - 100% pass rate is more important than coverage numbers

## 🔄 Next Actions

### Immediate (Today)
1. [ ] Install `@testing-library/react` and related dependencies
2. [ ] Update `vitest.config.ts` for JSDOM environment
3. [ ] Create test setup file with global mocks

### This Week
1. [ ] Complete testing infrastructure setup
2. [ ] Create first API route test (mottos route)
3. [ ] Establish testing patterns and procedures

### Next Week
1. [ ] Complete 2-3 more API route tests
2. [ ] Achieve 20-25% coverage
3. [ ] Start planning Tier 3 testing approach

*Remember: Quality over quantity. Better to have 25% coverage with meaningful tests than 80% coverage with brittle, unreliable tests.*
